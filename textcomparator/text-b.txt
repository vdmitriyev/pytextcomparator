Current work presents new approach for designing business intelligence solutions. In the era of big data, former and robust analytical concepts and utilities needs to adopt themselves to changed market circumstances. Main focus of the work is to address acceleration of building process of a "data-centric" business intelligence solution on one side, and also prepare business intelligence solutions for big data utilization. Research is addressing following goals: (a) reduce time spent during business intelligence solution designing phase; (b) achieve flexibility of business intelligence solution by removing problems with adding new data sources; (c) prepare business intelligence solution for utilization of big data concepts. Research proposes extension of existing Extract, Load and Transform (ELT) approach to the new one Extract, Load, Transform and Analyse (ELTA).
